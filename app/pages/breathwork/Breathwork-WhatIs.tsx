// Transformational Breath® was developed over four decades by Dr J Kravitz, creator of the preeminent Transformational Breath® Foundation, awarded Best Complementary Medicine Organisation by the ICNM.  Transformational Breath® is an open-mouthed, conscious breathing technique, with no pauses, which is gentle yet powerful. If you're familiar with Wim Hof, Rebirthing or Holotropic breathwork you'll be interested to know that Transformational Breath® has expanded beyond these modalities, integrating various insights from Kundalini Yoga, breath analysis, sound healing, and acupressure - alongside a spiritual framework that's accessible to all. Personal coaching is also a valuable aspect of the session. In addition to the Transformational Breath® Foundation being the go-to breath school for healthcare professionals worldwide, all graduates are accredited by the International Coaching Federation.
