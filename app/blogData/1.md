The way we breathe has a profound impact on our physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Transformational Breath® is a powerful, integrative breathing technique that aims to bring balance and healing to the body, mind, and spirit. But what exactly is it, and how can it benefit you? What evidence is there that it really makes a difference? This article answers all of these questions so that you can feel confident before booking your first session.

# Key takeaways
- In a Transformational Breath® session you breathe consciously in a deep, circular pattern to change your body’s internal chemistry.
- Transformational Breath® also incorporates coaching techniques, positive affirmations, acupressure, sound and movement.
- There is scientific evidence to support the benefits of breathwork including studies researching pain management, cortisol levels, heart rate, the vagal nerve, and more.


# The Basics of Transformational Breath®
Transformational Breath® is a unique form of conscious breathing that helps you tap into the body’s natural ability to release energetic blockages in your fascia tissue - the root causes of physical and emotional dis-ease. Developed by Dr. Judith Kravitz in the early 1980’s, the method integrates elements of breathwork, sound, movement, acupressure and affirmations to promote personal growth and healing.

Unlike shallow, unconscious breathing that we often do in our day-to-day lives, Transformational Breath® encourages you to breathe deeply, bringing more oxygen into your system and activating the parasympathetic nervous system for relaxation and healing.

# The Ingredients of a Transformational Breath® Session
Transformational Breath® uses a specific breathing pattern to help you access different layers of your being. The process typically involves:
1. **Circular Breathing**: This refers to a connected, continuous inhale and exhale without pausing between the two. By breathing in a circular pattern, you promote the flow of energy through the body and release stuck emotions and stress.
2. **Conscious Breathing**: Practitioners are guided to become more aware of their breath, which helps to break the pattern of shallow or inefficient breathing. Through conscious awareness, you can release tension and begin to restore balance.
3. **Use of sound**: During the process, sounds—such as humming or vocalising are used to further relax the nervous system and break through energetic blockages. These sounds can assist in emotional release and help amplify the healing effects of the breath.
4. **Movement**: Sometimes, movement is incorporated to further facilitate the release of energy and to allow the body to process emotions more effectively. Movement can help the breath deepen and become more fluid.
5. **Acupressure**: Gentle pressure applied to acupressure points all over the body encourages the flow of breath and helps to release tension and trauma from the fascia tissues - the ‘issues in your tissues’ so to speak.
6. **Affirmations**: Positive affirmations are often used to help reprogram limiting beliefs in the subconscious mind and support emotional healing. These affirmations increase the overall effectiveness of the breathwork process.

# The Benefits of Transformational Breath®
There are numerous benefits to practising Transformational Breath®, both physical and emotional. Some of the most commonly reported benefits include:
- **Reduced stress and anxiety**: By engaging in deep, conscious breathing, the body can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to a state of relaxation and calm. Many people find that after a breathwork session, their stress levels are significantly reduced.
- **Increased emotional clarity**: Transformational Breath® helps to uncover and release repressed emotions, which can lead to emotional clarity and healing. By consciously breathing through unresolved feelings, individuals may experience a sense of emotional freedom and peace.
- **Improved mental focus**: Deep breathing helps to increase oxygen flow to the brain, which can improve concentration, mental clarity, and focus. Many people report feeling clearer and more centred after a session.
- **Enhanced physical health**: Deep, full breathing brings more oxygen into the body, which supports the optimal functioning of all systems. It can also help with issues like chronic pain, fatigue, and even improve lung capacity.
- **Greater self-awareness and personal growth**: The process of Transformational Breath® encourages self-awareness and mindfulness, which can lead to profound shifts in one’s perspective. People often report feeling more connected to their authentic selves and more empowered to make positive changes in their lives.

# The Scientific Evidence Behind Transformational Breath®
There is growing interest in understanding the scientific basis for Transformational Breath® and its effects, and a substantial body of scientific literature to support the benefits of breathwork and conscious breathing practices in general. Let's explore some of the key areas where science intersects with the principles behind Transformational Breath®.

## 1. Breathwork and Stress Reduction: The Science of Cortisol and Heart Rate Variability
One of the core benefits often cited by Transformational Breath® practitioners is its ability to reduce stress. This is primarily due to breathwork’s effects on the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary bodily functions like heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate.

In a 2013 study published in The International Journal of Yoga, researchers examined how slow, controlled breathing impacts cortisol levels (a primary stress hormone) and heart rate variability (HRV), which is an important indicator of the body’s ability to handle stress. The study found that slow, diaphragmatic breathing led to reduced cortisol secretion and improved HRV, suggesting that deep breathing has a calming effect on the body’s stress response.

Transformational Breath® uses continuous, circular breathing which promotes this parasympathetic “rest and digest” response, allowing for the reduction of stress hormones and improvement in stress tolerance. In fact, some people report feeling an immediate reduction in anxiety after practising Transformational Breath®, which aligns with these physiological effects.

## 2. Breathing and Emotional Regulation: The Role of the Vagus Nerve
The vagus nerve is a key player in regulating the parasympathetic nervous system. Its activation has been shown to promote emotional calm, reduce anxiety, and foster emotional resilience. Various forms of breathwork, including Transformational Breath®, activate the vagus nerve through slow, deep, and controlled breathing patterns.

A study published in Frontiers in Psychology (2016) highlighted vagal tone as a central mediator of emotional regulation. In this study, controlled slow breathing led to an increase in vagal tone, which was associated with a decrease in anxiety and negative emotional states. By activating the vagus nerve, breathwork helps to restore balance between the body’s stress and relaxation systems, supporting emotional regulation and a sense of well-being.

Transformational Breath® uses a circular breathing style, combined with sound and movement, which likely enhances this vagal response, which may explain the emotional release and sense of calm that many people experience during sessions.

## 3. Breathwork and Trauma Healing: The Use of Somatic Practices
As all followers of renowned physician and author Gabor Maté know, trauma is stored in the body, manifesting as chronic tension, pain, or psychological distress. Breathwork has long been a tool for releasing this stored trauma, and there is increasing scientific support for its effectiveness in this area. Somatic therapy, which focuses on the connection between the mind and body, incorporates breathwork as a central technique for trauma healing.

A study in the Journal of Traumatic Stress (2014) examined how breath-focused therapies help individuals process unresolved trauma. The research showed that techniques like holotropic breathwork (which Transformational Breath® has built upon and exceeded in scope) were effective in facilitating emotional release and processing traumatic memories. This aligns with the goal of Transformational Breath® to help individuals release trapped emotions and past trauma through conscious breathing.

Trauma-informed facilitators also safeguard against the possibility of being re-traumatised during a breathwork session, through sensitive, client-centred approaches and a robust understanding of the physiology of trauma and its safe integration.

## 4. Breathwork and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and Cognitive Benefits
Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections. Conscious breathing has been shown to positively influence this brain plasticity, with implications for improving emotional well-being, memory, and cognitive function.

A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience (2015) demonstrated that controlled breathing patterns can alter brain activity, enhancing cognitive performance and emotional control. By using techniques like Transformational Breath®, which involves deep, rhythmic inhalation and exhalation, individuals may be able to improve mental clarity, focus, and overall cognitive function.

Additionally, breathwork has been linked to increased alpha brainwave activity, which is associated with states of relaxation and mindfulness. Research published in Psychophysiology (2017) found that breath-focused practices like yoga and meditation increase alpha waves, which help to reduce mental chatter and promote calmness. This effect is likely amplified in the dynamic breathing process of Transformational Breath®, which combines breath with sound and movement to facilitate a more profound mental shift.

## 5. Breathwork for Pain Management: Reduced Sensitivity and Healing
Breathing techniques are also gaining recognition for their role in pain management. A study in The Journal of Pain (2016) found that breath-focused therapies significantly reduced pain intensity in patients suffering from chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and musculoskeletal pain. These therapies work by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, which can counteract pain and inflammation.

Transformational Breath® focuses on deep, full breaths which increase oxygenation and circulation throughout the body to promote tissue healing and alleviate pain. This makes it an effective tool for those experiencing chronic pain or recovering from injury.

Moreover, breathwork helps reduce sympathetic nervous system activation, which is often associated with heightened sensitivity to pain. By promoting relaxation and better oxygenation, Transformational Breath® may support the body’s ability to self-regulate and heal more effectively.
